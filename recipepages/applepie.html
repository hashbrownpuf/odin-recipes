        <h2>Detailed Description Below</h2>
        <P>My mom's Easy Apple Pie is the dessert that I grew up on, and my own children now describe it as "perfect!" This simple, quick treat takes advantage of a shortcut store-bought crust -- and nobody will ever know! With plenty of fresh apples and warm spices in the filling, this is the best easy apple pie recipe you'll ever taste.</P>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <P>
            <ul>
                <li>1 box (14.1 oz.) refrigerated pie crusts</li>
                <li>6 cups peeled, thinly sliced Granny Smith apples</li>
                <li>¾ cup sugar</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
                <li>¾ teaspoon cinnamon</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon nutmeg</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>Optional for serving: vanilla ice cream or whipped cream</li>
            </ul>
        </P>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <P>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 425° F. Bring refrigerated pie crusts to room temperature.</li>
                <li>Unroll 1 pie crust and press it into a 9-inch glass pie plate. Cover and chill the crust for 10-15 minutes while you prepare the filling.</li>
                <li>In a large bowl, toss together all of the filling ingredients.</li>
                <li>Transfer filling to the pie plate. Unroll the second pie crust and place it on top of the apples.</li>
                <li>Tuck the extra top crust under the bottom crust edge, pinching together with your fingers to seal.</li>
                <li>Cut slits in the top of the pie (to allow steam to vent).</li>
                <li>Bake for 40-45 minutes, or until apples are tender and crust is golden brown. </li>
                <li>Cool pie on a wire rack for at least 2 hours before slicing and serving.</li>
            </ol>
